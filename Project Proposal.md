Project Proposal

Question - 
One of our clients, WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY), wants to gather signatures as much as possible based on the placement of the street teams. 

Purpose - 
Based on time and locations from MTA data, I will gather total number of ENTRIES and EXITS and rate top 5 stations. Then, I will categorize by days and calculate by time to analyze the traffic hours. Determine the peak hours so that WTWY will know what time will be best to place the teams. I will also categorize the time into part of the day to determine if morning or evening is more busy.

Data - 
I would import the data from MTA dataset and try minimize the loss of the data. Using Python's library, Seaborn and PANDAS, I will calculate the fields, remove erroneous data, and aggregate by station and date. I would use demographic and geographical data to determine number of commuters and find relevant correlations.
