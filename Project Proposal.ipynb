    "Question - One of our clients, WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY), wants to gather signatures as much as possible based on the placement of the street teams.\n",
    "Purpose - Based on time and locations from MTA data, I will gather ENTRIES and EXITS and rate top 5 stations. I will categorize by days and calculate by time to analyze the traffic hours. Determine peak hours so that WTWY will know when the best time to place the teams. I will also categorize time into parts of the day to determine if morning or evening is more busy."

    "Data - I would import the data from MTA dataset and minimize the loss of the data. Using Python's Seaborn and pandas, I will calculate fields, remove erroneous data, and aggregate by station and date. I would use demographic and geographical data to determine commuters and any other correlations."
