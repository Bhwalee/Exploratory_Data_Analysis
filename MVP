My main goal for this project was to determine the correlation between the day and time. This method will give me an insight to know which day will be the most busy during what time.

First, I would categorize each time to different parts of the day i.e., between 0 to 4 would be midnight, 5-10 morning, 11-4 afternoon, 5-8 evening, and 9-12 night. 
Then, I would seperate each columns by Mon - Sun to validate which days tend to be more busy than other days. Using visuals from Matplot, I would make a correlation graph where it shows a comparison between what day and # of entries, and during what time vs. # of total entries.

In the end, the results should give a greater insight in regards to what day and time will be the best chance to put the street teams to get the most signatures.
