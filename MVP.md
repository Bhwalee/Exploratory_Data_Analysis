My main goal for this project is to determine the correlation between time and day. This method will give me an insight to know what day will be the busiest during the specific time of the day.

I would first categorize recorded time to different parts of the day i.e., between 0 to 4 would be midnight, 5-10 morning, 11-4 afternoon, 5-8 evening, and 9-12 night. Then, I would seperate each columns by Mon - Sun to validate which days tend to be more busy. Using visualizations from Matplotlib and Seaborn, I would make graphs that show the correlation between what day and # of entries, and during what time vs. # of total entries.

Graphs will provide a greater insight in regards to what day and time will be the best timing to put the street teams to receive the most signatures.
